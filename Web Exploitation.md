# 1. Web Gauntlet

> web sql injection

## Solution:

- the input given was in the format 'text'. we could trick the server by writing the second inverted comma in the input itself and writing our desired commands after that. the first three challenges could be solved simply by ending the input with an inverted comma and then with a semicolon for it to ignore whatevers after that and let us bypass it. the next two challenge did not allowed to write the word admin therefore we use the OR operator to split the word into two bypassing the filter but still giving the input as admin

```
admin';
admin';
admin';
adm'||'in';
adm'||'in';
```

## Flag:

```
picoCTF{y0u_m4d3_1t_79a0ddc6}
```

## Concepts learnt:

- web sql injection and that we can trick it end the input using inverted comma and write our desired commands precedding that. there are multiple ways to input a string and the filters were only on a few of them therefore we could use other methods to bypass
- 

## Notes:

- there were many other ways to bypass the filters and one of the other was the UNION command which could be used in the 4th round 
- 

## Resources:

- searched in google different commands which i can use to bypass the filters

# 2. SSTI1

> Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)

## Solution:

- The goal is to find any object accessible within the template. this is a bypass i found on an online article. the popen id command lets us check if the bypass is working. after we confirm that we use the ls command to see the files present from where we find that there is a flag file. we run the cat flag command to get our flag

```
{{request.application.__globals__.__builtins__.__import__('os').popen('id').read()}}
{{request.application.__globals__.__builtins__.__import__('os').popen('ls').read()}}
{{request.application.__globals__.__builtins__.__import__('os').popen('cat flag').read()}}
```

## Flag:

```
picoCTF{s4rv3r_s1d3_t3mp14t3_1nj3ct10n5_4r3_c001_bdc95c1a}
```

## Concepts learnt:

- A server side template injection is a vulnerability that occurs when a server renders user input as a template of some sort. Templates can be used when only minor details of a page need to change from circumstance to circumstance. This can be abused, since some template engines support some fairly complex functionality, that eventually allow for developers to run commands or file contents straight from the template
- 

## Notes:

- The payload through available Python objects to find a way to import the os module, which can execute shell commands. The goal is to find any object accessible within the template. the popen command on the payload runs a shell command and the read commands reads the output of the popen command
- 

## Resources:

- searched in google SSTI and found a article on bypassing (https://onsecurity.io/article/server-side-template-injection-with-jinja2/)

# 3. Cookies

> changing data in the cookies 

## Solution:

- we go the cookies menu in the developers tab and see that the cookies change when we change the value. by a simple manual binary search we find out that the max value for a valid value is 28. we than manually type numbers from 1 to 28 to check the cookies and see the flag in the value 18.

## Flag:

```
picoCTF{3v3ry1_l0v3s_c00k135_cc9110ba}
```

## Concepts learnt:

- Cookies are small text files that websites store on your device through your web browser. They help sites remember information about the users and their visits. The cookies are updated every time between the client and server on every site visit
- 

## Notes:

- we can use cookies to change the values and get information we want
